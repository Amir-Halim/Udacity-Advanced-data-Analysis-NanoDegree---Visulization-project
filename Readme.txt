Main findings from the exploratory data analysis, and how you chose the results to put in your explanatory analysis.
*After grouping with weekdays, we can see that Friday, Saturday and Sunday are the highest while middle of week (Wednesday & Thursday) were less by far 
*Regarding the trip durations, the trips ranged from 1 to 1424 minutes.
Most trips seemed short with average 12 minutes, but most of this count were less than 10 (explained by left skewed chart)
*When comparing the bike riders ages, We found that the average age is 35 years and rider's count peaked between 30 & 35 years then kept sharply decreasing as age increase afterwards
*As shown above, Males have the highest count of rides throughout the month compared to Females
*While when comparing the average of trips for each gender, females took longer durations throughout the month with one exception on day 23 where the males exceeded with slight difference. Male trips averaged 11 minutes vs Female trips averaged 13 minutes
*Eventhough Males have more tirps compared to females, the average duration for females was higher
*Despite subscribers are the majority type; Customers show higher average duration in both Male and Female
*The total duration is led by subscriber, Males significantly more than females. Same distribution with customers but with much less total duration compared to the subscribers
